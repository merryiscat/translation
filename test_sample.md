# Sample Research Paper

## Introduction

This is a sample research paper to test the translation system. It contains various markdown elements that need to be preserved.

## Mathematical Equations

The equation for energy-mass equivalence is:

$$E = mc^2$$

Where $E$ is energy, $m$ is mass, and $c$ is the speed of light.

## Code Examples

Here's a simple Python function:

```python
def hello_world():
    print("Hello, World!")
    return True
```

The function uses `print()` to display output.

## Conclusion

This sample demonstrates all the elements that should be preserved during translation.
